    "body-2": "Our curriculum is heavily past-paper centric. In contrast to the normal after-the-syllabus past paper preparation, we expose our students to difficult past exam questions while going through lessons in the syllabus in parallel. This allows students to develop both the theoretical knowledge and practical techniques needed to tackle any standardized exam.",
    "body-3": "Every week, we encourage students to sit a chapter end test for each of their subjects. This acts as revision for the students and as a summative assessment for the teachers.",
    "body-4": "Midterm exams are conducted halfway (or at times, one-third) through the course and Final exams at the end of the year. These validate the academic performances of students while also identifying those in need of an extra push in studying.",
    "body-5": "We offer students struggling in their academics personalized classes, taught by none other than their subject teachers and graduates of IIP that completed their levels with flying grades."
