        Year 1 to 9 classes refer to the first nine years of compulsory
        education in many countries, including the UK. Students typically start
        Year 1 at the age of 5 or 6 and progress through to Year 9 at the age of
        13 or 14. During these years, students study a range of subjects,
        including English, Mathematics, Science, History, Geography, Physical
        Education, and sometimes a foreign language. The focus of these classes
        is on developing foundational knowledge and skills, including literacy
        and numeracy, critical thinking, and problem-solving. The curriculum is
        usually designed to be broad and balanced, providing a good foundation
        for further study at the secondary level. Students are assessed
        regularly throughout the year, with teachers providing feedback on their
        progress and areas for improvement.
