        A-Level (Advanced Level) is a two-year advanced secondary education
        program that follows on from the IGCSE. It is offered in many countries,
        including the UK, and is a widely recognized qualification for entry
        into higher education institutions. A-Level courses are typically more
        specialized and in-depth than IGCSE courses, and students usually choose
        to study 3 or 4 subjects in greater detail. The subjects available can
        include Sciences, Mathematics, and Business subjects. Students take
        exams at the end of the two-year program, and their performance
        determines their A-Level grades, which can be used for university
        admission or employment purposes. A-Levels are often considered to be
        more challenging than IGCSEs and require a greater level of academic
        maturity and independence.
